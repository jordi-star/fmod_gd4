2. Clone `fmod_gd4` into Godot's `modules/` folder.
> `cd modules && git clone https://github.com/summertimejordi/fmod_gd4`
3. Download [FMOD Engine 2.02+](https://www.fmod.com/download#FMOD%20Engine-select)
4. Copy FMOD API folders to the `api` folder in the `fmod_gd4` module.
5. [Compile Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/development/compiling/introduction_to_the_buildsystem.html?highlight=compile)

**Not done yet!**
Your newly built version of Godot will need to have the following libraries included in the same folder as it.

Locate the libraries by navigating to the `api` folder you copied into the module path.

**You will need:**
		The Fmod library located in `core/lib`, and the Fmod Studio library located in `studio/lib`.

You'll see folders named after the architecture they're designed for. (x86 for 32-Bit, x64 for 64-bit, and arm for Mac Sillicon)

**On Windows:**
	Copy `fmodL.dll` and `fmodstudioL.dll` to your Godot location.

**On Mac and Linux:**
	Copy `libfmodL.so` and `libfmodstudioL.so` to your Godot location.

**This process can be confusing. Create an issue or DM me on Discord `jordi â˜…#0317` for further support!**
